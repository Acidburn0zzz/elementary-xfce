This is an icon-theme maintained for Xfce.
It's a fork of the upstream elementary-project, which took place because the team decided to drop a lot of desktop-specific symlinks. This icon-theme is supposed to keep everything working, but we'll still pull new icons from upstream and integrate them occasionally.

Todo/Open issues:
* add missing icons/symlinks so that this icon-theme is usable without needing gnome-icon-theme-full
